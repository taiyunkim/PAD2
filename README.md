This repository contains the source codes of PAD2 (https://pad2.maths.usyd.edu.au/).

## Background

Cooperative binding of transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin remodelers at specific genomic regions regulate gene transcription programs. Characterising TF genomic colocalisation is therefore essential for identifying cooperative binding of TFs in controlling gene expression. 

PAD2 is an easy-to-use interactive web application that enables the investigation of colocalisation of various TFs and chromatin-regulating proteins from mouse embryonic stem cells at various functional genomic regions.


## Requirements

PAD2 is developed in Python3, using Django framework. The required versions of dependent packages are available in the `requirements.txt`.
